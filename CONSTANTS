#This is a comment :D
#Python ignores comments
#Comments are used to explain the code
#The best programmers comments all their code
#the programmers dont comment at all

#Example
name = "dave" #this is a variable called name - variable stores information until it its value is changed
print(name) #This displays whatever is in name 



print("Hello, its me")
me = int(input("How old are you"))
if me == 7:
    print("same")
else:
    print("No I am seven.")
